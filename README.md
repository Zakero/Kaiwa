Kaiwa
=====

A distributed internet chat application.
"Kaiwa" (kai-wa) is the Japanese word for "communication".

Why Another Chat Program
------------------------

Most IRC type programs, like X-Chat, rely on a client-server model.  And if the
server becomes unavailable for some reason, communication among the clients
will be lost.

The goal of this project is to experiment with how to make a distributed
communication system.
