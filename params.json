{"body":"Kaiwa\r\n=====\r\n\r\nA distributed internet chat application.\r\n\"Kaiwa\" (kai-wa) is the Japanese word for \"communication\".\r\n\r\nWhy Another Chat Program\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nMost IRC type programs, like X-Chat, rely on a client-server model.  And if the\r\nserver becomes unavailable for some reason, communication among the clients\r\nwill be lost.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to experiment with how to make a distributed\r\ncommunication system.\r\n\r\nThe User Interface will be based on __Qt4__.\r\n\r\nDevelopers\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### Building The Project\r\n\r\nThe first time you clone or make any invasive changes, run the setup script:\r\n```\r\n> ./setup.sh\r\n```\r\nThis will create a new QT Project file and a new Makefile.\r\n\r\nIf any changes need to be make to the QT Project file, place these changes in\r\nsetup script instead.  This will allow qmake to do the heavy lifting when new\r\nsource code is added or moved around.  Then the script will add the finishing\r\ntouches.\r\n\r\nAnd finally:\r\n```\r\nmake && ./Kaiwa\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Generating The Documentation\r\n\r\nTo create the documentation, you will need [Doxygen][].  And if you want to\r\nmake the graphs, you will also need [Dot][Graphviz].\r\n\r\nUse the following command to generate the documentation:\r\n```\r\n> doxygen Doxyfile\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n[Doxygen]:  http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen \"Doxygen\"\r\n[Graphviz]: http://www.graphviz.org/             \"Graphviz\"\r\n","name":"Kaiwa","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
